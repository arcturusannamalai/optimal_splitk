Welcome to optimal_splitk!
==========================
**optimal_splitk** is a Python library designed for optimal split^k-plot designs based on the coordinate exchange algorithm. It includes the fast update procedures
outlined in the article. It generalizes the update formulas to models of the type :math:`Y = X \beta + \sum_{i=1}^{k+1} Z_i \gamma_i`.

The design section details how the code is designed, for mathematical derivations, see the article and supplement. The API
section refers to exact documentation per function when using the library.
